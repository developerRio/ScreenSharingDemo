# ScreenSharingDemo
This sample basically inlcudes a feature (Cature & Share), so what it does, you can capture out any spcefic view (obviously you need to define it in the code), saves the screenshot in internal memory, you can fetch it, share it to any platform you want to ✌ Will be updating the code further & yes as always it's made with ❤ in kotlin.
